I’m MD Mazul Haque, a software engineer with a passion for solving real-world problems through automation, data-driven decisions, and AI innovation. From leading Windows OS migrations at TCS using PowerShell, to building impactful ML and NLP projects as a data analyst at Vitwo, I’ve always pushed the limits of what I can build and automate. My superpower lies in translating complex systems into simple, scalable solutions—often bridging backend logic with clean front-end experiences.

I’m constantly working to grow in leadership, product thinking, and research-level AI. Some coworkers think I’m overly focused or reserved, but I’m just deeply driven—I often dive headfirst into learning and building, even beyond work hours. Whether it’s mentoring juniors in Python or deploying neural networks for deep learning problems, I believe growth comes from stepping out of the comfort zone, solving hard problems, and sharing knowledge with others.
